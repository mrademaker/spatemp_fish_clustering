# Spatio-temporal clustering of fish biomass

This repository contains the data and code used to analyse the spatial-temporal clustering patterns of fish populations in the North Sea based on long-term systematic bottom-trawl survey data (1977-2019).
The repository consists of three sub-projects:

- [Data](Data) - contains the raw and filtered catch per unit effort per length class (cpue_length_per_hour) extracted from the public ICES-DATRAS database.
  (https://datras.ices.dk/Data_products/Download/Download_Data_public.aspx)
- [Script](Script) - here you can find the code used to go from the raw to the filtered dataset as well, as the subsequent modelling performed on the filtered dataset.
- [Clusters](Clusters) - the results of the analysis per species
